# personnel-tracking-system
* It is a simple automation system for personnel tracking.
* Datas are written and read in a text file.
* A certain number of records have been created on the text by using the information struct structure.
* There is a 'T' or 'F' character at the beginning of each record.
* A new recording will overwrite the first track that begins with the 'F' character.
* Those with the 'F' character are blank or deleted records.
